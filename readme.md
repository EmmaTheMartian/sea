# Sea

> *C for the modern world.*

Sea is a general-purpose language made to allow programmers to write low-level
and performant code without needing to write C.

> If you are conversing about Sea vs C, then you may want to pronounce Sea as
> `see-uh` instead of `see` to prevent ambiguity. You could also call it
> `ocean`, `fish c`, or any other random thing that helps to fix the ambiguity.

**Features:**

- 100% interoperability with C. All C libraries can be cleanly used in Sea, and vice-versa too.
  - C interoperability is also completely overhead-free!
- As little ambiguity as possible (except in the pronunciation of Sea and C, whoops).
- No undefined variables and no null, except in inline C.
- Equally as fast as C since Sea gets transpiled to C.

**Inspired By:**

## Why?

I simply enjoy writing languages! :P

For a more "real" reason: I love writing C, however I also like modern syntax
and a more... usable standard library.

> C's stdlib is absolutely usable, however a modern stdlib designed around
> modern practices is significantly more usable than a stdlib designed around
> code practices from the 70s.
